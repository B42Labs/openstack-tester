// filter by tag), are reclaimed instead from recorded — the run record's created
// list — by id. recorded is nil when cleanup runs from a bare run id (--run-id),
// in which case address scopes cannot be reclaimed. It treats an already-gone
// resource as success — so running it twice is a no-op. Router interfaces are
// detached (not deleted) before the routers and subnets they attach can be
// removed; security-group rules are not handled because they cascade with their
// group. The first non-404 error stops the run and is returned with the count
