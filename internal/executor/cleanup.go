// filter by tag), are reclaimed instead from recorded — the run record's created
// list — by id. recorded is nil when cleanup runs from a bare run id (--run-id),
// in which case address scopes cannot be reclaimed. It treats an already-gone
// resource as success — so running it twice is a no-op. Floating IPs are removed
// first (an associated one pins its port and router); router interfaces are
// detached (not deleted) before the ports they attach are removed; a network is
// deleted before its subnets so its delete cascades the auto-created DHCP/service
// ports that would otherwise block an explicit subnet delete (SubnetInUse);
