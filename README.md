# openstack-tester

A scenario-driven load and consistency tester for OpenStack, starting with an
intensive focus on **Neutron** (networking).

The tool builds large, randomized but **reproducible** networking topologies
through the Neutron API in a single project, records how long every operation
takes and which states the resources reach, and is designed to later compare the
intended (API) state against the actual data plane (OVN / OVS).

> **Status:** Phase 1 in progress. The Go module, the `openstack-tester` CLI
> skeleton (the `neutron` command namespace), `clouds.yaml`-based
> authentication, the YAML scenario schema, the deterministic plan generator,
> the `generate` command, and `apply` (both `--dry-run` and the live executor,
> which builds the full tagged topology in dependency order and collects timing
> metrics) now exist. `apply` also pre-checks quotas before creating anything
> and persists a `run-<id>.json` record; `status` re-queries live state,
> `report` renders the metrics as table/JSON/CSV, and `cleanup` deletes a run's
> tagged resources idempotently. The `small`, `medium`, and `large` scenario
> profiles now ship under `scenarios/`; the optional Prometheus textfile export
> is the remaining Phase 1 item.

## 1. Goals

- Create **complex, randomized network scenarios** via the Neutron API, e.g.
  ~20 routers, ~100 networks, ~200 subnets, a handful of subnet pools, several
  security groups (with rules), and a number of ports.
- Make every scenario **fully parametrizable** (counts, ratios, topology shape)
  and **deterministic** via a random seed, so a run can be reproduced exactly.
- **Track timing and state**: how long each resource takes to create, how long
  it takes to reach its expected status, aggregate latency statistics, error
  rates, and total throughput.
- Run everything in a **single project** to begin with, with reliable,
  tag-based cleanup.
- Be structured so that **multiple named scenarios** (profiles) can be defined
  and selected.
- Lay the groundwork for a **later data-plane verification phase** that checks
  whether OVN (NB/SB) and OVS reflect what the API says should exist.

## 2. Non-goals (for now)

- **No VMs / Nova.** Phase 1 is networking only.
- **No load balancers (Octavia).**
- **No floating IPs / external gateways** as a hard requirement (optional, and
  only if an external network is available — see roadmap).
- Not a correctness test suite like Tempest; this is a **load, timing and
  consistency** tool. The two are complementary.

## 3. Scope by phase

| Phase | Focus | State |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **1** | Generate + apply randomized networking topologies via the API; record timings and states; tag-based cleanup. | Planned (this README) |
| **2** | Data-plane verification: reconcile API state against OVN NB/SB DB and OVS flows. | Future |
| **3** | More scenario profiles, optional external connectivity (gateways, FIPs), trunk ports, RBAC, address scopes. | Future |
| **later** | Extend beyond Neutron (Cinder, Nova, …) — hence the generic name `openstack-tester`. | Idea |

## 4. Core concepts

The design separates **what we intend to create** from **what actually
happened**. This split is what makes both reproducibility and the later
data-plane verification possible.

- **Scenario** — a high-level, parametrized description of the desired topology
  (counts, ratios, topology shape, RNG seed). Lives in a YAML file or is
  selected from a built-in profile. Human-authored.
- **Plan** — the concrete, fully-expanded set of resources and their
  relationships, produced deterministically from `scenario + seed`. Every
  network, subnet, router interface, port, security group rule is enumerated
  with its intended attributes. The plan is the **source of truth / expected
  state** and is the input for Phase 2 verification. Machine-generated, can be
  dumped to JSON for inspection.
- **Run** — one execution of a plan against a cloud. Produces created resource
  IDs, per-operation timings, observed states, and errors. Persisted as a run
  record (`run-<id>.json`) so it can be reported on, re-checked, or cleaned up
  later.
- **Metrics** — timing and state statistics derived from a run.

```
scenario.yaml ─┐
               ├─►  generate  ─►  plan.json  ─►  apply  ─►  run-<id>.json ─►  report
   seed ───────┘                    │                          │
                                     └────────► (Phase 2) verify ◄── OVN/OVS
```

## 5. Neutron resources covered (Phase 1)

Created in dependency order; torn down in reverse.

1. **Subnet pools** (and optionally **address scopes**) — a small number,
   shared by subnets that opt into pool-based allocation.
2. **Networks** — the bulk; tenant networks (geneve/vxlan by default).
3. **Subnets** — multiple per network; some from explicit CIDRs, some allocated
   from a subnet pool; IPv4 and (optionally) IPv6.
4. **Routers** — internal routers.
5. **Router interfaces** — attach a subset of subnets to routers, forming
   randomized but valid topologies (a subnet attaches to at most one router).
6. **Security groups** + **security group rules** — several groups, each with a
   randomized rule set (ingress/egress, protocols, port ranges, remote CIDR or
   remote-group references).
7. **Ports** — created on networks/subnets, with security groups attached;
   fixed IPs either auto-allocated or explicitly assigned.

### Dependency graph

```
address scope ──► subnet pool ──► subnet ──► router interface ──► router
                                    ▲
network ────────────────────────────┘
   └──────────────► port ◄────────── security group ◄── security group rule
```

**Optional / later:** external router gateways, floating IPs, trunk ports,
RBAC policies, port forwarding, QoS policies.

---

## 6. Scenario parametrization

A scenario is defined by counts, ratios and distributions plus a seed. Example
(`scenarios/medium.yaml`):

```yaml
name: medium
seed: 1234567                 # deterministic; same seed => same plan

resources:
  subnet_pools:   3
  address_scopes: 0
  networks:       100
  routers:        20
  security_groups: 15

distribution:
  subnets_per_network:   { min: 1, max: 3 }    # ~200 subnets total
  ports_per_network:     { min: 0, max: 5 }
  rules_per_security_group: { min: 2, max: 12 }
  subnet_from_pool_ratio: 0.4                   # 40% of subnets use a pool
  ipv6_ratio:            0.2
  subnets_attached_to_router_ratio: 0.6

topology:
  router_attach_strategy: random   # how subnets are distributed across routers
  port_security_group_count: { min: 1, max: 3 }
```

The example from the original request (20 routers / 100 networks / 200 subnets /
a few subnet pools / various security groups / some ports) maps directly onto
such a file and ships as the `medium` built-in profile (see below).

Parameters can be overridden on the CLI (e.g. `--set resources.networks=200`)
without editing the file, to make sweeps easy.

Generation is deterministic: the same `scenario + seed` always expands to a
byte-identical plan, stable across runs and Go versions. The global `--seed`
flag overrides the scenario's `seed`. Plan CIDRs are allocated deterministically
from non-overlapping ranges — explicit IPv4 subnets from `10.0.0.0/8`, IPv6
subnets from `fd00::/16`, and subnet pools from `172.16.0.0/12`.

### Built-in profiles

Three ready-to-use profiles ship under `scenarios/`, selected by passing the
file path to `--scenario`:

| Profile | Networks | Routers | Subnets | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| `small`  | 3   | 2  | ≤ 9  | Fits Neutron's default per-project quotas. |
| `medium` | 100 | 20 | ~200 | The headline example above; needs raised quotas. |
| `large`  | 200 | 40 | ~400 | Twice the headline; needs raised quotas, guarded by the `apply` quota pre-check. |

```
openstack-tester neutron generate  --scenario scenarios/medium.yaml [--out plan.json]
openstack-tester neutron apply     --scenario scenarios/large.yaml  [--dry-run]
```

---

## 7. CLI design

A single binary `openstack-tester` with subcommands (Neutron grouped under a
`neutron` namespace to leave room for other services later):

```
openstack-tester neutron generate  --scenario medium.yaml [--out plan.json]
openstack-tester neutron apply     --scenario medium.yaml [--dry-run]
openstack-tester neutron status    --run run-<id>.json
openstack-tester neutron report    --run run-<id>.json [--format table|json|csv]
openstack-tester neutron cleanup   --run run-<id>.json   # or --run-id <id>
openstack-tester neutron verify    --run run-<id>.json   # Phase 2 (future)
```

- `generate` — expand a scenario into a plan and dump it; never touches the API.
- `apply` — generate (or load) a plan, create resources, poll states, record a
  run record + metrics. `--dry-run` validates and prints what would be created.
- `status` — re-query the current state of a run's resources from the API.
- `report` — render metrics from a run record (table / JSON / CSV).
- `cleanup` — delete all resources belonging to a run, in reverse dependency
  order; idempotent. Tag-discoverable resources are found by the run tag; address
  scopes (which Neutron may not let us tag) are reclaimed from the run record by
  id, so reclaiming them needs `--run`, not a bare `--run-id`.
- `verify` — (Phase 2) compare run/plan against OVN/OVS.

Global flags: `--os-cloud` (defaults to `$OS_CLOUD`), `--concurrency`,
`--timeout`, `--seed` (override scenario seed), `--log-level`.

---

## 8. Configuration & authentication

Authentication follows the same `clouds.yaml` convention as the rest of the
testbed (see [`../openstack-cli`](../openstack-cli)). gophercloud v2 reads
`clouds.yaml` natively:

```go
authOptions, endpointOptions, tlsConfig, err := clouds.Parse() // OS_CLOUD
providerClient, err := config.NewProviderClient(ctx, authOptions,
    config.WithTLSConfig(tlsConfig))
netClient, err := openstack.NewNetworkV2(ctx, providerClient, endpointOptions)
```

`clouds.Parse()` honors `OS_CLOUD` and the standard search paths (current
directory, `~/.config/openstack`, `/etc/openstack`). The testbed CA must be
trusted (see the `openstack-cli` README for placing `testbed.crt`).

Run from anywhere with API access (operator workstation or a manager node).
Phase 2 additionally needs access to the OVN databases / OVS on the
control/network nodes.

---

## 9. Metrics & state tracking

Every Neutron API call is wrapped with timing instrumentation that records:

- resource type, operation (`create` / `get` / `delete`), wall-clock duration,
  success/error, HTTP status, and a timestamp.
- **Time-to-ready**: for resources with a status field (ports, networks,
  routers), the time from "create returned" to "status == expected" (e.g. a
  port reaching `ACTIVE`/`DOWN`), measured by polling with backoff.

Reported per resource type and overall:

- counts (attempted / succeeded / failed),
- latency stats: min / mean / median / p90 / p95 / p99 / max,
- throughput (operations per second), effective concurrency,
- total wall-clock for the run,
- error breakdown (timeouts, 409 conflicts, quota, 5xx, …).

`report` renders a run record's metrics in three formats:

- human-readable **table** on stdout (the default),
- **JSON** metrics (machine-readable),
- **CSV** with one row per resource type plus an overall row.

The canonical run record itself is the `run-<id>.json` written by `apply`. An
optional **Prometheus textfile** export to fit the testbed's monitoring is
planned but not yet implemented.

---

## 10. Execution model

- **Dependency-ordered**: resources are created in topological order and removed
  in reverse. Independent resources of the same kind are created concurrently.
- **Concurrency**: a configurable worker pool (`--concurrency`) bounds parallel
  API calls. `context.Context` carries cancellation and per-operation timeouts.
- **Retry/backoff**: transient errors (5xx, 409 conflicts, rate limiting) are
  retried with exponential backoff; quota errors fail fast with a clear message.
- **Tagging**: every created resource is tagged with a run identifier (e.g.
  `ostester:run=<id>` plus type/index tags). Cleanup operates strictly on these
  tags, so it never touches resources the tool did not create. Tagging address
  scopes is best-effort — some Neutron releases return 404 for it — so a tag
  failure there is logged and tolerated (and left out of the metrics); those
  resources are instead reclaimed at cleanup from the run record, by id.
- **Naming**: deterministic names like `ostester-<id>-net-0001` for easy
  identification in Horizon / the CLI.

---

## 11. Quotas & prerequisites

Large scenarios will exceed Neutron's **default per-project quotas** (typically
10 networks, 10 subnets, 10 routers, 10 security groups, 100 SG rules, 50 ports).
A 100-network / 200-subnet / 20-router scenario therefore requires quotas to be
raised first.

This is resolved as **document-and-require** (see open questions): `apply`
**pre-checks quotas** against the expanded plan and aborts early with an itemized
message before creating anything if they are insufficient, leaving the operator
to raise the quotas. The tool does **not** auto-raise quotas through an admin
cloud — that would require admin credentials it otherwise never needs. The
pre-check fails open (it logs a warning and proceeds) when the project cannot
read its own quota, with the executor's quota fast-fail as the backstop.

---

## 12. Safety

- Operates only within the project of the selected `clouds.yaml` entry.
- `cleanup` deletes **only** resources from a known run — tag-matched, plus
  address scopes reclaimed from that run's record by id.
- `--dry-run` for `apply` to preview without creating anything.
- No destructive defaults; the cloud and project must be chosen explicitly.

---

## 13. Tech stack

- **Go 1.26.4**
- **[gophercloud v2](https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud)** —
  `github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/v2` and its
  `openstack/networking/v2/*` packages (`networks`, `subnets`, `subnetpools`,
  `routers`, `ports`, `security/groups`, `security/rules`, `attributestags`).
- `clouds.yaml` loading via
  `github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/v2/openstack/config` +
  `.../openstack/config/clouds`.
- CLI: `github.com/spf13/cobra` (subcommands).
- Scenario files in **YAML**; run records / metrics in **JSON**.

## 15. Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 — API load & timing**
   - [ ] Scaffold module, CLI, `clouds.yaml` auth.
   - [ ] Scenario schema + deterministic generator (seeded).
   - [ ] `generate` (plan dump) + `--dry-run`.
   - [x] Neutron resource wrappers (pools, networks, subnets, routers,
         interfaces, security groups + rules, ports) with tagging.
   - [x] Dependency-ordered, concurrent executor with retry/backoff.
   - [x] Metrics collection and state polling.
   - [x] Run records, `status` re-query, and `report` (table/JSON/CSV).
         (Prometheus textfile export still pending.)
   - [x] Tag-based `cleanup`; quota pre-check.
   - [x] Built-in profiles (incl. the 20/100/200 example).
2. **Phase 2 — data-plane verification**
   - [ ] Compare API/plan against OVN NB/SB and OVS flows.
3. **Phase 3+** — external connectivity, trunk ports, RBAC, QoS, more profiles,
   other services.

## 16. Open questions / decisions to confirm

- **Quotas**: **resolved** — document-and-require. `apply` pre-checks the
  expanded plan against the project quota and aborts early with an itemized
  message; raising the quota is the operator's step. Auto-raise via an admin
  cloud is deliberately not implemented (see §11).
- **Network types**: **resolved** — geneve/vxlan tenant networks only; the
  generator emits plain tenant networks with no provider attributes (VLAN/flat
  deferred to Phase 3).
- **IPv6**: **resolved** — dual-stack subnets are emitted in Phase 1,
  controlled by `distribution.ipv6_ratio` (set it to 0 for IPv4-only).
- **External connectivity**: skip gateways/FIPs in Phase 1, or wire them up if
  an external network is configured?
- **CLI framework**: **resolved** — `cobra`.
- **Module path**: **resolved** — `github.com/B42Labs/openstack-tester` (the
  module lives at the repository root, not under `contrib/`).
```
